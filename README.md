**JieqiBox** is a cross-platform desktop application (with partial Android support) for playing and analysing Jieqi (揭棋).  
Built with Tauri and Vue 3, it aims to be a lightweight yet capable companion for casual players and engine developers alike.

You can compile a supporting engine from the official Pikafish repository at <https://github.com/official-pikafish/Pikafish/tree/jieqi> or <https://github.com/official-pikafish/Pikafish/tree/jieqi_old>.
